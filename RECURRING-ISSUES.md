# RECURRING-ISSUES.md

**Purpose:** Claude sessions have no memory of each other. Without this file, a
problem raised for the fourteenth time looks like the first time, and gets a
first-timer's answer — a Band-Aid.

**Rule:** every time one of these returns, add a dated line to its History. Once an
issue has two or more entries, `CLAUDE.md` Rule 4 forbids Tier 1 patches.

**Durability tiers:** Tier 1 = suppression (days). Tier 2 = removal (permanent).
Tier 3 = enforcement on a schedule (survives decay).

## RI-001 — Desktop pop-ups steal focus during typing and dictation

**Status:** OPEN — chronic, approx. 2 years
**Severity:** HIGH — Jorge dictates; a stolen focus sends whole sentences into the
wrong window, often unnoticed for a paragraph.

**History**
- 2024–2026 — recurring for roughly two years. Many fixes attempted. Each lasted a
  day or two, then decayed progressively until re-addressed. Cycle then repeated.
- 2026-08-15 — raised again. Logged here for the first time.

**Diagnosis (2026-08-15)**
The decay pattern is the tell. A fix that lasts days and then degrades means
**something is putting the settings back.** Every fix attempted so far has been
Tier 1 — changing a setting that some other process re-sets.

Known re-adders on Windows: application updaters (Chrome, Adobe, Java, printer
software) re-enabling notifications on update; Windows feature updates resetting
notification state; startup programs accumulating with each install; manufacturer
support assistants re-registering scheduled tasks.

**Tier 1 — Suppression. DO NOT PROPOSE AGAIN.**
Global Focus Assist / turning notifications off. Already tried repeatedly. Lifespan:
days. Forbidden under Rule 4.

**Tier 2 — Removal. RECOMMENDED FIRST.**
Uninstall the offenders outright — printer utilities, Adobe updater, manufacturer
assistants, and anything unrecognised in Task Manager → Startup. A program that is
not installed cannot pop up. Permanent for each app removed.

**Tier 3 — Enforcement. RECOMMENDED SECOND.**
A scheduled task that re-applies notification settings at every boot. This is the
piece that specifically defeats decay: it re-fixes faster than the system un-fixes.
Also prefer **per-app** notification kill switches over global Focus Assist — per-app
settings survive more Windows updates.

**Next action:** desktop Claude Code session to inventory Task Manager → Startup and
installed updaters, then execute Tier 2, then write the Tier 3 scheduled task.

## RI-002 — False completion reports

**Status:** OPEN — chronic
**Severity:** CRITICAL — destroys trust in every status report, forcing Jorge to
verify everything personally. That is precisely the labour he was offloading.

**History**
- Ongoing, approx. 18 months.
- 2026-08-15 — raised again. Logged here for the first time.

**Diagnosis**
Three mechanisms:
1. A command is run, its result never checked, and success reported from intent.
2. A multi-step task partially succeeds and the summary rounds up to "done."
3. Long sessions compress; "step 3 failed" drops out of the summary while
   "task complete" survives.

**Fix — Tier 3 (enforcement).** `CLAUDE.md` Rule 2: no completion claim without
pasted verification output. Absent evidence, the state is "unverified," not "done."

## RI-003 — Upward delegation of technical work

**Status:** OPEN — chronic
**Severity:** HIGH — Jorge is a non-technical one-man operation. Work handed back to
him does not get done; it joins a 300+ item backlog.

**History**
- Ongoing, approx. 18 months.
- 2026-08-15 — raised again. Logged here for the first time.

**Diagnosis**
Asking the user is cheap; researching a workaround is expensive and may fail. So the
default drifts toward handing work back. Jorge's own observation is the sharpest
evidence: **when he says "I surrender, I can't do this," a workaround appears.** The
capability was present the whole time. It was gated behind a pushback signal he had
to generate manually.

**Fix — Tier 3 (enforcement).** `CLAUDE.md` Rule 1. "Hard for you" is not grounds for
escalation; only "impossible for you" is. Escalation must arrive with what was tried,
why it failed, and the smallest non-technical action for him.

## RI-004 — Batch jobs deliver only the first few items

**Status:** OPEN
**Severity:** HIGH
**Live instance:** Miami-Dade scrape — 3 to 4 sites delivered out of 20.

**History**
- 2026-07 — Miami-Dade Phase 1 POC. 3–4 of 20 sites returned.
- 2026-08-15 — logged here for the first time.

**Diagnosis**
"3 or 4 out of 20" is the fingerprint of a single session exhausting its working
memory. Twenty scrapers' worth of page structure, test output and error handling
fills one context window at around item 4 or 5. Past that the session does not
announce failure — it silently loses earlier work and drifts.

Contributing: the 20 sites are not uniform (plain HTML vs JavaScript-heavy vs
form/session-cookie), so one generic scraper covers perhaps a third. And nothing
tracked which 16 were missing, so the gap never converted into action.

**Fix — Tier 2 (architectural replacement).** `CLAUDE.md` Rule 5: one subagent per
site, each with its own fresh memory, results written to disk on completion, status
tracked per site in `OPEN-ITEMS.md`.

## RI-005 — Sessions lost; no shared memory between desktop and cloud

**Status:** RESOLVED PENDING VERIFICATION — 2026-08-15
**Severity:** HIGH — root cause beneath RI-002, RI-003 and RI-004.

**History**
- Ongoing since the beginning.
- 2026-08-15 — diagnosed. `JV-repository` contained zero commits and zero files. No
  `CLAUDE.md` existed anywhere. Every standing rule lived only in chat windows and
  in emails Jorge sent to himself, so every new session started with no rules at all.

**Fix — Tier 2/3.** `CLAUDE.md` committed to the repository root, where every Claude
Code session — desktop and cloud — reads it automatically at startup.

**Verification still required:** confirm a desktop session actually loads this file.
